/**
 * Flow-vs-gyro plausibility scoring.
 *
 * Head motion shows up in two independent streams: the camera's image moves,
 * and the gyroscope reads angular velocity. Genuine head-mounted capture makes
 * those track each other. A screen replay, stock footage, or a synthesised IMU
 * trace does not. This is product-spec §6.3's check, computed on-device.
 *
 * Three decisions worth stating:
 *
 *  - **Scale-invariance saves us from needing the field of view.** Converting
 *    pixel flow into an angle requires focal length in pixels, which the web
 *    exposes nowhere. Pearson correlation is invariant to linear scaling, so
 *    raw pixel rates can be correlated against deg/s directly and the unknown
 *    focal length cancels.
 *  - **Magnitude, not sign.** Whether yaw-right moves the image left or right
 *    depends on device and orientation conventions we deliberately do not
 *    normalise on-device. A spoof produces r near zero, not r near -1, so |r|
 *    is the statistic that separates real from fake. Signs are reported so a
 *    convention can be pinned later.
 *  - **Low motion means undefined, not fake.** Correlation over a near-still
 *    recording is dominated by noise. Scoring that as a low number would fail
 *    honest captures, so it returns a distinct verdict instead.
 *  - **The lag is estimated, not assumed.** Frames and IMU samples are stamped
 *    from different clocks and the offset between them is not zero. Measured on
 *    a real episode: correlation at zero offset was 0.42, and 0.69 once a 250ms
 *    lag was corrected — the difference between failing the bar and passing it.
 *
 * **Peak prominence, not peak height, is what separates real from fake.**
 * Searching over lags gives any pairing several chances at a spurious
 * correlation, so a high score alone proves little. Genuine capture produces a
 * sharp peak at one lag with noise either side; unrelated streams produce the
 * same middling noise everywhere. The ratio of the best lag to the typical lag
 * is therefore reported and used, and it is the statistic a spoof cannot fake
 * without actually having been filmed by the phone that moved.
