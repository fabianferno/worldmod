 * What to do when a capture has too little head motion to score plausibility.
 *
 * The flow-vs-gyro check needs the head to rotate. Seated desk tasks — typing
 * being the clearest case — barely move it: a real keyboard capture measured
 * 0.8 deg/s on device, well under the threshold where correlation means
 * anything. Requiring plausibility on such a bounty would reject every honest
 * submission, so the bounty states its position instead of the validator
 * guessing.
 *
 *   "require"      — an unscorable episode is rejected. For tasks with real
 *                    head movement, where a still capture is suspicious.
 *   "allow_static" — an unscorable episode is accepted and marked as carrying
 *                    no motion evidence. Honest for seated tasks, and weaker:
 *                    these episodes are the easiest in the network to fake.
