/**
 * Server-side validation of a submitted episode.
 *
 * This is product-spec §6.3's validator, and the honest framing from §6.2
 * applies to every line of it: a PWA cannot attest that pixels came from a
 * real camera at a real time. Nothing here proves physical origin. What it
 * does is:
 *
 *   - verify INTEGRITY, by recomputing every hash from the bytes that arrived
 *     rather than trusting what the client claimed;
 *   - measure PLAUSIBILITY, from cross-modal agreement and the completeness
 *     of what was delivered;
 *   - detect NEAR-DUPLICATES, which is what defends the economics.
 *
 * Scores arrive as an explicit argument and are never read out of the
 * manifest. That distinction is the whole point: a contributor seals their own
 * commitment, so a manifest declaring 100% cross-modal agreement is internally
 * consistent, hashes correctly, and means nothing. Only numbers this server
 * measured from the uploaded bytes are allowed to reach a check.
